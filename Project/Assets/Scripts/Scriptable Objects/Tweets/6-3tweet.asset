  tweetText: "This isn\u2019t the way. We can\u2019t just go after everyone we suspect
    without proof. We risk becoming what we hate. We must remember that justice is
    not just about punishment, but also about healing and understanding. If we let
    anger and revenge guide us, we risk losing our humanity.  #JusticeWithIntegrity
