  tweetText: "I used to think Ian was the answer, that his way was the only way to
    bring justice. But seeing how far this has gone, how many innocent lives have
    been destroyed... I\u2019m not so sure anymore. Maybe we\u2019ve lost sight of
    what justice really means. Maybe it\u2019s time to stop and think about the consequences.
