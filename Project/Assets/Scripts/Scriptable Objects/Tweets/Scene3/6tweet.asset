  tweetText: "To my new followers: After all what I have been through, I realize
    that justice isn\u2019t just about punishing the guilty; it\u2019s about healing
    the wounds we all carry. The world is full of pain, but it\u2019s also full of
    hope. We must choose whether to perpetuate the cycle of violence or break free
    from it. My path has led me here, but the journey for true peace is far from
    over. May we all find the strength to choose compassion over revenge, and to
    build a world where future generations can live in peace.\n\n#BreakTheCycle #HealingTogether
    #CompassionOverRevenge"
